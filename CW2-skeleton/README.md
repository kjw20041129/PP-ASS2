## How to Run the Game

### Prepare a Maze File
The game requires a maze file to load the map. You can either:
1. **Manually create a maze file** (see format below), or  
2. **Generate one** using the provided tool.

---

### Manually Create a Maze File
1. Use a text editor to create a maze file.
2. Follow this format:
   ```plaintext
   ##########
   #S       #
   # # ######
   # #      #
   # ###### #
   #       E#
   ##########
   ```
3. **Requirements**:
   - Must contain **one `S` (start)** and **one `E` (end)**.
   - Dimensions (width/height) must be **between 5 and 100**.
   - Valid characters: `#` (walls), ` ` (empty spaces), `S`, `E`.

---

### Generate a Maze File
1. Compile the maze generator:
   ```bash
   gcc -o mazegen mazegen.c -I.
   ```
2. Generate a maze:
   ```bash
   ./mazegen <filename> <width> <height>
   ```
   - Replace `<filename>` with your maze file name.
   - Set `<width>` and `<height>` to values **between 5 and 100**.

---

### Compile the Game
1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the game project directory.
3. Compile the game:
   ```bash
   gcc -o maze main.c game.c maze.c -I.
   ```

---

### Start the Game
Run the game with your maze file:
```bash
./maze <maze_file>
```
- Replace `<maze_file>` with the path to your maze file.

---

## Gameplay
- **Movement Controls**:
  - `W`: Move up
  - `A`: Move left
  - `S`: Move down
  - `D`: Move right
  - `M`: Display maze
  - `Q`: Quit game
- **Objective**: Reach the endpoint (`E`) to win.

---

## Example
1. For a maze file `example.maze`:
   ```plaintext
   ##########
   #S       #
   # # ######
   # #      #
   # ###### #
   #       E#
   ##########
   ```
2. Start the game:
   ```bash
   ./maze example.maze
   ```

---

## Important Notes
- Ensure your maze file is **correctly formatted**.
- The generator will discard mazes with **no valid path**.
- Missing `S` or `E` will trigger an error and prevent the game from starting.
